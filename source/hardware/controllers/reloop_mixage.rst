Audio
-----

This controller is a MIDI and audio class compliant device so it is compatible as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. On Windows, the manufacturer ships an :term:`ASIO` low-latency driver that can be found on the `manufacturer‚Äôs product
page <productpage_url_>`_.

The microphone :hwlabel:`üé§` input can be set to different modes. To make it usable in Mixxx, set it to **SW**. The :hwlabel:`MASTER` and :hwlabel:`PHONES` level controls work directly on the audio hardware and can't be mapped in Mixxx.
