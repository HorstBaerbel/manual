Audio
-----

This controller is a MIDI and audio class compliant device so it is compatible as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. On Windows, the manufacturer ships an :term:`ASIO` low-latency driver that can be found on the `manufacturer‚Äôs product
page <productpage_url_>`_.

The microphone :hwlabel:`üé§` input can be set to different modes. To make it usable in Mixxx, set it to **SW**. The :hwlabel:`MASTER` and :hwlabel:`PHONES` level controls work directly on the audio hardware and can't be mapped in Mixxx.

Mixer Section
-------------

All mapped controls use MIDI channel #1 (can be changed on the back of the device). Most functions on this controller are self-explanatory and mapped in that way. The others are explained here:

The effect buttons and knobs on the left side apply to effect rack 1, the ones on the right to effect rack 2.

User-adjustable script settings
-------------------------------

The `Reloop-Mixage.scripts.js` controller script provides the following settings:

-  Scratch behaviour can be changed to a more regular, turntable-like mode by changing the setting `scratchByWheelTouch` to `true`. Note that the jog wheels are not very sensitive to touch though (sensitivity can be adjusted on the back of the controller).
-  Scratch speed can be adjusted by changing the setting `scratchTicksPerRevolution`. Smaller values "scratch more" of the track, larger values "scratch less".
-  Jog wheel scroll speed can be adjusted by changing the setting `jogWheelScrollSpeed`. The higher, the faster.
-  To automatically resize the library and hide the decks for better browsing set `autoMaximizeLibrary` to `true`. The decks will be shown again after `libraryHideTimeout`, or when selecting a song into a deck after `libraryReducedHideTimeout`.

As a warning the `LOAD` LEDs will be on if that deck is currently playing.

Jog wheel and pitch slider
--------------------------

Touch and move the jog wheel while the loupe icon :hwlabel:`üîç` is active to scratch (either deck playing or not).
Touch and move the jog wheel while the disc icon :hwlabel:`üíø` is active to scroll through the track (either deck playing or not).
Touch and move the jog wheel while none of the above are active to nudge the deck (deck playing).

The pitch sliders let you adjust pitch. The :hwlabel:`-` / :hwlabel:`+` buttons let you temporarily adjust the the speed one step higher / lower (aka nudge the deck).
